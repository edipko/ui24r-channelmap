NodeJS project to connect to a SoundCraft Ui24R mixer (or use a backup files from the same) and create a formatted list of the input channels.

It is often hard to see from the Ui24R UI host the physical channels are laid out since multiple channels can use the same physical input.  This is intended to use for a Sound Tech or muscians to know where to plug into the system, or perhaps a stage snake

ToDo: Add host to deplot and provide how I setup a RaspberryPi as an internet gateway and to host this project.
